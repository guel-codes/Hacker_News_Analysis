# Hacker_News_Analysis

## This is a quick analysis of Hacker News Posts
- It is important to note that the data set was reduce from 300,000 posts to 20,000 by taking out all posts that not have comments. This reduction to 20,000 would normally be apart of our data cleaning process but Dataquest did it for us luckily.
- I only did an analysis of the "Ask HN" post (larger average comments per post). If you want to analyze the 'Show HN' posts then you can fork the repo and start from there.

Thank you,
